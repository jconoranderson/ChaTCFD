# SynergE6 Healthspan Model (Summary)

The SynergE6 framework weaves medicine, science, therapeutic environments, and active living into one coordinated plan so each person experiences better health, stronger community ties, and a meaningful daily life. Its six connected pillars are:

- **Evaluation** – Interdisciplinary medical, developmental, emotional, and environmental assessments that drive highly individualised care plans and ongoing review.
- **Environment** – Purposeful physical, temporal, and social spaces that minimise sensory stress, support regulation, and create healing, independent living opportunities.
- **Eating & Nutrition** – Therapeutic, medically informed diets that optimise gut health, immunity, metabolism, and overall wellbeing for every stage of life.
- **Energy Regulation** – Structured movement, therapies, and daily routines that balance arousal states, build stamina, and promote restorative sleep.
- **Emotional Regulation** – Targeted supports that build resilience, reduce anxiety, and teach adaptive coping so relationships and mental health can flourish.
- **Evidence-Based Education & Treatment** – Research-driven teaching and therapeutic interventions that build functional skills, communication, autonomy, and lifelong learning.

Together these elements form a living system of care—healing from the inside out by addressing symptoms, daily living, emotional wellbeing, and social participation in a seamless, evidence-grounded way.
